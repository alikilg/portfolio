    <p class="par" id="p1">HIYA!</p>
    <p class="par" id="p2">Gonna try and explain whatâ€™s going on in this never-ending story thing, I guess :DDD</p2>
    <p class="prg" id="p3">"Sooo... our <span style="font-style: italic;">"fairytale"</span> revolves around this dark and treacherous scheme, set by a group of undergrad students; Desperate and utterly frustrated by their consecutive failures in exams and assignments, they collude with a bunch of evil digital penguins (yes, penguins. ..don't ask me why--), in order to hack the servers and build a digital trap which would absorb their professor into the web world. That would supposedly protect them from possibly failing the upcoming exams yet once again ...or something.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p4">...to be honest, that's a really dumb idea, cause it's not like by getting rid of the teacher they were ever going to get a good grade in any way either ðŸ™„</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p5"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cough <span style="font-size: 29px;">cough</span></span> <span style="font-size: 30px;">ANYWAY</span></p>
    <p class="prg" id="p6">The website starts off with this page, which, at first glance, could kind of resemble the portfolio assignment the students initially had to make; Although already a bit messed up-looking (or something)â€¦</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p7">After a brief, nonsense ish conversation with the penguin -yeah, there's already a random penguin in there-, the screen suddenly goes FLASH (or so it is supposed to anyway-) and the prof is getting absorbed into the<span style="font-family: 'Frijole'; font-size: 21px;"> dark, true insides of the web.</span></p>
    <p class="prg" id="p8">Of course, this looks nothing like the enthralling, futuristic and daunting at the same time environment my creator had initially envisioned--</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p9">There are a few different routes that you can take from this point.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p10">One is this X icon, floating at the top left of the page. Basically it just closes the whole window and you get trapped into nothingness forever. (..that didnâ€™t sound deep enough, did it-)</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p11">Another option would be to go to this.. thing. Itâ€™s supposed to be a cheap media-sharing ish website, kind of like YouTube, but in this case entirely occupied by penguins (again). By following a couple of directions, using some extra buttons and moving on to the next pages (that were never, <span style="font-size: 27px">ever</span> created, for obvious reasons), the player would have the option to try and download themselves as a media something (<span style="font-style: italic">hopefully</span> escaping that way), but then soon theyâ€™d encounter an antivirus program and.. welp, things wouldnâ€™t end very well.  ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p12">The archive button takes yâ€™alls to a really, extremely BADLY coded webpage. A literal mess. The nightmare of every web designer who <span style="font-size:23px">ÏƒÎ­Î²ÎµÏ„Î±Î¹ Ï„Î¿Î½ ÎµÎ±Ï…Ï„ÏŒ Ï„Î¿Ï…</span>. Messed up codes, double slide bars, ads, overlapping elements, dated design, scattered gifs, timidly shining here and there like the dim, dreary lights of an abandoned amusement park, and, of course, heaps of viruses. ...Soon as the viruses spot the new <span style="font-style: italic">guest</span>, they devour him.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p13">^By the way yeah, this page was eventually never created either.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p14">Finally, shoving the penguin outta the way reveals a secret portal which takes you even <span style="font-style: italic">deeper</span> into the site. Thatâ€™s the route with the longest story progression as well.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="pA">I'm still not quite sure why I started narrating his whole thing in English instead of Greek-</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p15">POOF</p>
    <p class="prg p16" id="p16">Yep. Welcome to the backstage~ Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>
    <p class="prg p16" id="p17">Wandering around the source page, the prof goes deeper and deeper into the countless lines of code and eventually encounters binary digits (which are represented by light bulbs, because during an <span style="font-style: italic">Introduction to Computer Science I</span> lecture in our first semester in 2014 we were told that the 0 and 1 thingies are like lamps that are getting switched on and off). The bulbs are desperate and depressed because, after having been moved all around the place by the penguins, they miss their old positions, jobs and friends. The likewise trapped hero offers to help them return to their former places, also in an attempt to try and fix this mess and fight back the darn hackers, but accidentally ends up breaking one of the bulbs during the process-- The rest of them go MAD.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p19">Initially there was another route here, in which the prof and the bulbs would become friends, as, by choosing different responses to the dialogue, things would never lead up to one of the poor bits getting killed. Subsequently they would hang out together and then later on the player would be given the choice to either enjoy this new digital life and decide to stay, leading to a pretty questionable <span style="font-style: italic">good end</span>, oR miss their home and be determined to do anything and everything in their power to return. In that case, the bulbs would then help and guide the professor to some sort of a "coding room", which we will come back to later on again, while following the previous route.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p20">However, this option was discarded before it even had the chance to come to fruition, along with several other thingies from the original plan, as the deadline was drawing nearer and the anxiety of my creator was rising.. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p21">MOVING ON!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p22">In an instant, the bitwise police arrives at the crime scene, pursuing the unwitting murderer!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p23">There are two options for the player here again. One is to try and run away; Before <span style="font-style: italic;">tragedy</span> struck, the bulbs had talked about how there's another portal nearby that takes you to a mysterious "window thing". The professor quickly figures that is nothing else than the well-known to y'all, inspect element! (That's also that "coding room" we had mentioned here a little earlier.) Once arriving there, they try and use the few futures and capabilities that the inspect element provides, in a desperate attempt to code a way to freedom.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p24">Now, if they don't run away from the crime scene, they get arrested and are taken by the policebulbs to prison. There, awaits a bunch of virus inmates, who are very, very eager to see what this mysterious newcomer <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> exactly!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p25">Oh, by the way, back at the Coding Room, there was also a <span style="font-style: italic;">Do-Not-Press button</span>, that if you did press, it summoned the police over there and they arrested you anyway lol.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p26">To be honest, our creator had started working a little bit on those places too. But since the coding for this route in fact stops right after one of the bulbs gets killed, there is no way for anyone to access those pages by simply wandering around the original assignment; So Iâ€™ll put two links here for you to get an idea what theyâ€™d look like instead! They are not in their final form yet (and are probably never going to be smh) and obviously lack all sorts of dialogues etc as well :0</p>
    <a class="prg plink" id="pL1" href="links/coding/inspect.html" target="Inspect Element">>> To the Coding Room</a>
    <a class="prg plink" id="pL2" href="links/jail/prison.html" target="Prison">>> To Prison</a>
    <p class="prg" id="p27">Throwing the prof in the prison cell, the police bulbs lock the bars behind them and walk away, as the viruses curiously surround their newest guest. The intense, almost menacing even look in their eyes would be enough to make anyone's blood run cold on the spot. The prof quickly gets up from the cold prison ground and gulping back any fear, they chuckle nervously as they try to introduce themselves.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p28">Once again, depending on the choices the player makes, the conversation can take a couple of different directions at this point.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p29">On the one hand, the viruses are probably going to realize how this weird-looking <span style="font-style: italic;">data</span> was an actual human being until not too long ago and, to make matters worse, a former computer user, who obviously hated viruses and used to pursue the extinction of their very existence!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p30">So then, the viruses devour the professor.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p31"><span style="font-size: 27px;">...Then again</span>, they might as well see them as yet another enemy of the cops, hence in fact an unforeseen friend of their own! Eventually, they all decide to collaborate in order to escape the cruel prison and revolt against the websiteâ€™s <span style="font-style: italic;">authorities</span>. Combining forces <span style="font-size: 21.5px;">and digital literacy skills</span>, they examine the prison code all over again and soon are able to tear down the enemy walls surrounding them!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p32">Here's a very underdeveloped demo of kkkk<span style="font-style: italic;">kkind of</span> what decoding the prison cell would be like..</span>
    <a class="prg plink" id="pL3" href="links/demo/prison.html" target="very underdeveloped demo">>> very underdeveloped demo</a>
    <p class="prg" id="p33">As the last few bits of wall drop idle, out of charge, on the ground, there is a long, yet narrow hallway appearing before the prisonersâ€™ eyes. But as they start walking stealthily down the shadowy bits, the police, unsurprisingly already alert of the rebelsâ€™ <span style="font-style: italic;">wicked</span> deeds, arrive from both sides of the hallway, blocking their way!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p34">They are about to charge at them, when the professor instead manages to strike a conversation with the police bits and soon, viruses, patrol and the outsider all agree to work together and fight against the penguin ish invaders having taken over their peaceful home!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p35">But then <span style="font-family: 'Gloria Hallelujah', cursive; font-size: 22px;">suddenly</span> at that point, they hear a scary and intense buzzing sound and the walls around them start to shake violently, soon crashing into a myriad of corrupted bits. The broken bits begin to dance wildly through the air around our heroes and itâ€™s not long before the start gathering together into groups and forming into shapes that soon turn out to be giant and evil, very evil-looking penguins! Outraged at how their enslaved <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 22px;">minions</span> (the police) have just betrayed them, they seek nothing but to crash everybody on the spot.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p36">Our heroes gulp in fear but try to maintain their composure, despite the giant penguins approaching menacingly. Having been caught off-guard, they go into defence positions and try to concentrate on the bits and the code that assembles the penguins. <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;">The great fight of bits and hacking has finally <span style="font-size: 26px;">begun!</span></span></p>
    <p class="prg" id="p37">TWO ROUTES HERE AGAIN~</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p38">In the first route they eventually manage to win and triumph over the invading army of djdmghish birds! They kick them out, regaining control of their sweet home.</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p39">Now they are also finally able to access the code that was used to absorb the professor into the website and they work to quickly modify it, so it can be used in reverse. They throw a party to celebrate their hard-earned freedom and honour the professor for the invaluable help and support they have provided. Finally, at the end, they bid farewell and then use the newly updated code to help the professor return back to their own home, at the normal world, on the earth!!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p40">THE OTHER ROUTE IS THAT THE SERVER ENDS UP OVERHEATING FROM ALL THE FIGHTING AND INFORMATION ALTERING AND CRAZY DECODING THATS GOING ON AND IT EVENTUALLY CRASHES AND EVERYONE DIES.</p>
    <P class="prg" id="p41">The end :)</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p42">Yeee that was it!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p43">Well, honestly, I cannot understand how I ever thought this would be possible to actually make as an aCtUaL playable game/website, let alone within just a few days, LET ALONE during exam period----</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p44">But either way, thank you so much for sticking with me while trying to explain what that assignment would potentially be like!</p>
    <p class="prg" id="p45">If you want to check out the few pages that were made <span style="font-size:14px;">in 2017</span>, then here you go!</p>
    <a class="prg plink" id="go" href="../old/warn.html">Go <span style="font-size:80px;">&#x27ad;</span></a>
    <p class="prg" id="p46">SEEYA~</p>
